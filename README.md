# a_pixel_game

A local network browser game about drawing pixels. It's pretty fun. Was made in 2 days so don't expect the best code quality, but it works (if you're connected well enough) and that's what matters. Also this was written for my birthday party (21.04.2006) and likely won't be developed much afterwards. If anyone wants to pick up on this project, go for it.
